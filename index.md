### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I've enjoyed the game blackjack and wante to see how it works. I was able to calculate the total score of two cards put together and identify which cards are face cards and their values. Learning how to decide how much the Ace card is worth was also fascinating to me.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because I always was interested in creating mini games like this one. In this lab I was able to create a interative game where a user can guess a secret number. Learning to code a way to count how many guesses he has and if he wins or lose was also fascinating. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I it was cool to see that one can find the population just by putting the county in as an input. It was fascinating to see that the program will list all the counties to choose from if the input isn't specific. It was cool to see that it will print error messages too if the county is spelled wrong.
